## Split

Share bills with friends and family, and keep track of spendings. Put in how much each person contributed and Split will tell you how much to give which friend to divide the bill evenly. Or start adding individual items to tally how much you owe for what you ordered or bought. 

Edit and work on shared receipts together with friends at the same time.
